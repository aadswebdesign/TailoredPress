### Intro

**First this:** This is by no way a replacement of wordpress.

**Disclaimer:** I don't take any liability for the use of this package, that is solely for yourself. Aside of that this package is in development stage and most isn't working or has to be tested/adjusted whatever.

**Credits to:** 
- Todo

**Also:** I have a great respect for the people who are working on it, just I have different ideas of how to do certain things.

**Aim:** Creating a package that exists of php objects (oop), is namespaced, lighter and safer.

**Why?** Well, over the years I felt limited when working with it. I prefer to work the oop way and therefor I already had created a library with reusable classes within the 'themes' folder, just often I had to deal with the flat php files within wp and especially the admin panel.

**A work in progress** Yes, As I have created a lot already, there still is a long way to go and learn along the way.

**Get it done?** Now I have tackled a lot of challenges already and make progress but still who knows?

**For who?** For those who know of how to create php classes or are willing to learn that!

**My knowledge** As I learn a lot with this, still there is more I don't - as I do know.

- php: reasonable but it is getting better while working on this project.
- js:  basic but I'm sure it will improve when I start working with it for this project.
- html/css/svg: good , I have a good grasp on that.
- git: limited: have to grow into it.
