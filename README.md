**First this:** This is by no way a replacement of wordpress.

**Also:** I have a great respect for the people who are working on it, just I have different ideas of how to do certain things.

**Aim:** Creating a package that exists of php objects (oop), is namespaced, lighter and safer.

**Why?** Well, over the years I felt limited when working with it. I prefer to work the oop way and therefor I already had created a library with reusable classes within the 'themes' folder, just often I had to deal with the flat php files within wp and especially the admin panel.

**A work in progress** Yes, As I have created a lot already, there still is a long way to go and learn along the way.

**Get it done?** Now I have tackled a lot of challenges already and make progress but still who knows?

**For who?** For those who know of how to create php classes or are willing to learn that!

**About me** My knowledge about php is limited too but got better since I'm working on this. I have learned lot the last 6 months.

#####More to come!
