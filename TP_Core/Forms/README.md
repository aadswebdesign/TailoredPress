### TP_Core/Forms 


**Note:** For what it is now and subject to change. Also one of my habbits is to give classes/methods a name that speaks for itself.

**Sub folders:** Each of those sub folders will have their own readme with more info.

**Files:** 
- README.md
- TP_Comment_Form.php  
- TP_Default_Search_Form.php
